Imagine a pile of books on your desk. Each book is so large and heavy that you can remove only the top one from the pile. 
You cannot remove a book from under another one. Likewise, you cannot add a book beneath another one. 
You can add another book to the pile only by placing it on the top of the pile.
If you represent books by their titles alone, design a class that you can use to track the books in the pile on your desk.
Specify each operation by stating its purpose, by describing its parameters, and by writing a pseudocode version of its header.
Then write a Java interface for the pileâ€™s methods. Include javadoc-style comments in your code.
Define a class PileOfBooks that implements this interface. Use a resizable array in your implementation.
Then write a program that adequately demonstrates your implementation.
In this program, you will need to have 1 class with the name as PileOfBooks, 1 interface with the name as PileInterface,
and 1 test class to test everything.
